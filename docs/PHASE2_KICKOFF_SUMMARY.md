## Phase 2 Overview

### Goals

Phase 2 completes the remaining P1 priorities and prepares the platform for production deployment:

1. **Type Hints** - Enable IDE autocomplete and mypy validation (0% ‚Üí 90%+ coverage)
2. **Keyboard Navigation** - Achieve WCAG 2.1.1 Level A compliance (legal requirement)
3. **Integration Testing** - Validate all fixes work together (quality gate)
4. **CASCADE Research** - Investigate data integrity concerns (optional)

### Why This Matters

**Developer Impact:**
- Type hints enable IDE autocomplete and catch bugs before runtime
- mypy static checking prevents type-related errors
- Better code documentation for onboarding

**User Impact:**
- Keyboard users can complete exercises (currently impossible)
- Screen reader support for accessibility
- WCAG compliance reduces legal risk

**Quality Impact:**
- Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows
- Prevents regressions from Phase 1 fixes
- Enables confident production deployment

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Start with Type Hints (#026) ‚≠ê

**This should be your next task** - it's the quickest win with highest impact.

**Duration:** 6-8 hours
**Risk:** Low (zero breaking changes)
**Effort:** Moderate

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install mypy django-stubs djangorestframework-stubs types-requests

# 2. Create mypy.ini configuration
# (See docs/PHASE2_TRANSITION_PLAN.md for complete config)

# 3. Start with ViewSets
# - apps/api/viewsets/learning.py (2h)
# - apps/api/viewsets/exercises.py (2h)
# - apps/api/viewsets/community.py (2h)
# - apps/api/viewsets/user.py (1h)

# 4. Then repositories and services (2h)

# 5. Run mypy and fix errors
mypy apps/

# Target: 90%+ coverage, 0 errors
```

---

### Step 2: Keyboard Navigation (#027) ‚å®Ô∏è

**After type hints complete** - critical for accessibility compliance.

**Duration:** 8 hours
**Risk:** Moderate (frontend complexity)
**Compliance:** WCAG 2.1.1 Level A (ADA, Section 508)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# 1. Implement BlankRegistry class (2h)
# - Navigation tracking between blanks
# - getNext/getPrev methods

# 2. Add keyboard event handlers (3h)
# - Tab/Shift+Tab navigation
# - Arrow key navigation
# - Enter to submit
# - Escape to clear

# 3. Add ARIA attributes (2h)
# - role="textbox"
# - aria-label, aria-required
# - Screen reader instructions

# 4. Testing (1h)
# - Manual keyboard testing
# - Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS)
```

**Reference:** `todos/027-ready-p1-codemirror-keyboard-navigation.md`

---

### Step 3: Integration Testing (#028) üß™

**After type hints + keyboard nav complete** - quality gate for deployment.

**Duration:** 4 hours
**Risk:** Low (testing only)
**Dependencies:** #026, #027 must be complete

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# 1. Create backend integration tests (2h)
# - User lifecycle (sign up ‚Üí enroll ‚Üí delete)
# - Concurrent enrollment (100 users, 10 spots)
# - Performance (query count validation)
# - Security regression (.extra() check)

# 2. Create frontend integration tests (1h)
# - Setup Playwright
# - Accessibility tests (skip nav, keyboard nav)
# - axe-core scans

# 3. CI/CD integration (1h)
# - Add to GitHub Actions
# - Verify all tests pass
```

**Reference:** `todos/028-pending-p2-integration-testing-suite.md`

---

### Step 4: CASCADE Research (#023) üö´ OPTIONAL

**Only if Steps 1-3 complete early** - requires research first.

**Duration:** 2-4 hours (research only)
**Risk:** High (third-party dependency)
**Status:** BLOCKED - do not implement without research

**Research Questions:**
1. Can django-machina models be swapped?
2. Do proxy models work for FK changes?
3. Is forking machina necessary?
4. What's the migration impact (90+ relationships)?

**Reference:** `todos/023-ready-p1-cascade-delete-community-content.md`

## Phase 1 Context

### What Was Completed (6/10 P1 Todos)

| # | Todo | Impact | Effort | Tests |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| #018 | SQL Injection via `.extra()` | CVE-2025-SQL-001 | 4h | 5 |
| #019 | Mutable Default JSONField | Data corruption prevention | 2h | 12 |
| #020 | Skip Navigation Link | WCAG 2.4.1 Level A | 2h | 3 |
| #021 | Forum Pagination OOM | 100x memory reduction | 4h | 5 |
| #022 | Enrollment Race Condition | Atomic transactions | 3h | 5 |
| #024 | Soft Delete Infrastructure | GDPR Article 17 | 8h | 20 |

**Total:** ~23 hours, 63 tests, 0 regressions

### Key Patterns Established

**Security:**
- No `.extra()` usage (SQL injection prevention)
- Atomic transactions with `select_for_update()` (race condition prevention)
- Soft delete with PII anonymization (GDPR compliance)

**Performance:**
- Database-level pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET
- Query optimization with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`
- Constant query count regardless of page number

**Testing:**
- 100% pass rate required for merge
- Concurrency testing with `TransactionTestCase`
- Performance profiling with `tracemalloc`

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive session summaries
- Best practices guides
- CVE tracking for security issues

## Risk Management

### Known Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Type hints break existing code | Use mypy strict mode gradually, test thoroughly |
| Keyboard nav affects mouse users | Ensure mouse interactions still work, test both |
| Integration tests flaky | Use TransactionTestCase, avoid race conditions |
| CASCADE research reveals impossibility | Have backup plan (Phase 1 only, or postpone) |

### Contingency Plans

**If type hints take longer than 8 hours:**
- Focus on ViewSets first (highest value)
- Defer model methods to future session
- Accept 70-80% coverage initially

**If keyboard nav complexity exceeds estimate:**
- Implement Tab navigation first (core requirement)
- Defer arrow keys to future iteration
- Ensure WCAG 2.1.1 minimum compliance

**If integration tests reveal regressions:**
- Fix regressions before proceeding
- Update relevant todos
- Re-run all test suites

## Technology Decisions (From Research)

### For Future Phases

Based on Phase 2 research, these decisions are documented for Phase 3+:

**State Management:** Zustand (not Redux)
**Reason:** 70% less boilerplate, simpler API

**Caching:** Redis
**Reason:** 80% response time reduction

**Real-Time:** Django Channels + WebSockets
**Reason:** Native Django integration

**Code Execution Security:** gVisor Runtime
**Reason:** Kernel isolation for production

**Monitoring:** Sentry
**Reason:** Agentless, Django-native, <5min setup

## FAQ

### Q: Should I start with type hints or keyboard navigation?

**A: Start with type hints (#026).** It's lower risk, provides immediate developer experience benefits, and can be done incrementally. Keyboard navigation is higher complexity and requires frontend expertise.

### Q: What if I don't have time for all of Phase 2?

**A: Prioritize in order:**
1. Type hints (6-8h) - Quick win, high impact
2. Keyboard navigation (8h) - Legal compliance
3. Integration testing (4h) - Quality gate
4. CASCADE research (optional) - Only if time permits

### Q: Can I skip the integration tests?

**A: No.** Integration tests are the quality gate for production deployment. They validate that all Phase 1 + Phase 2 fixes work together and prevent regressions.

### Q: What if CASCADE research shows it's impossible?

**A: Document findings and archive todo #023.** Focus on Phase 1 approach (custom models only) or postpone to future phase. This is why research comes before implementation.

### Q: How do I know when Phase 2 is complete?

**A: All acceptance criteria met:**
- Type hints: 90%+ coverage, 0 mypy errors
- Keyboard navigation: WCAG 2.1.1 verified
- Integration tests: 5 suites, 100% pass rate
- Documentation updated
- All existing tests still passing

## Final Notes

**Current Status:** Ready to execute
**Next Action:** Start with type hints completion (#026)
**Estimated Completion:** 1-2 weeks (16-22 hours)
**Confidence Level:** High (clear requirements, proven patterns, low risk)

Phase 1 delivered exceptional quality with 6 critical fixes, 63 new tests, and comprehensive documentation. Phase 2 builds on this foundation with developer tooling, accessibility compliance, and quality assurance to prepare for production deployment.

**Good luck with Phase 2!** üöÄ
