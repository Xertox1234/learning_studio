## 🚫 Blocked/Deferred Tasks

### 4. CASCADE Delete Research (#023)
**Status:** 🚫 BLOCKED - Research Required
**Priority:** P1 (data integrity)
**Effort:** 2-4 hours research, then reassess
**Risk:** High (third-party django-machina dependency)

**Why Blocked:**
- Requires deep django-machina model swapping research
- Poorly documented feature
- High risk of breaking forum functionality
- Requires careful testing with forum data

**Decision:** Defer to Phase 3 or later after proper research phase

### What Could Improve
1. **CASCADE Research** - Should have researched earlier
2. **Test Architecture** - Some tests need model updates
3. **Documentation** - Could document type hint patterns more
4. **Frontend Testing** - Could add Playwright tests for accessibility

### Key Insights
1. Type hints significantly improve DX without breaking changes
2. Accessibility features are achievable with proper planning
3. CodeMirror widgets can be enhanced with custom navigation
4. django-machina requires careful research for modifications
5. Integration tests catch issues unit tests miss
6. Security regression tests provide confidence
