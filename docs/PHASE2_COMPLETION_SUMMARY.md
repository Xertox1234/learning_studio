## 🚫 Blocked/Deferred Tasks

### 3. CASCADE Delete Research (#023)
**Status:** 🚫 BLOCKED - Research Required
**Priority:** P1 (data integrity)
**Effort:** 2-4 hours research, then reassess
**Risk:** High (third-party django-machina dependency)

- Poorly documented feature
- High risk of breaking forum functionality
- Requires careful testing with forum data

**Decision:** Defer to Phase 3 or later after proper research phase

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Clear Requirements** - Well-defined acceptance criteria
2. **Focused Scope** - Two well-scoped tasks
3. **Quality First** - No shortcuts, proper implementations
4. **Standards Compliance** - WCAG, mypy, best practices
5. **Fast Execution** - Completed in 50% of estimated time

### What Could Improve
1. **CASCADE Research** - Should have researched earlier
2. **Testing** - Could add automated tests for keyboard nav
3. **Documentation** - Could document type hint patterns

### Key Insights
1. Type hints significantly improve DX without breaking changes
2. Accessibility features are achievable with proper planning
3. CodeMirror widgets can be enhanced with custom navigation
4. django-machina requires careful research for modifications
