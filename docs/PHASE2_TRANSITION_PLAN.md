### Prioritized Todo List

#### 1. Type Hints Completion (P1) ‚≠ê START HERE

**Status:** Ready
**Priority:** P1 Critical
**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Risk:** Low (zero breaking changes)
**File:** `todos/026-ready-p1-type-hints-completion.md`

**Why This First:**
- ‚úÖ Quick win with immediate developer experience impact

#### 4. CASCADE Deletes Research (P1) üö´ BLOCKED - RESEARCH FIRST

**Status:** Blocked (requires research)
**Priority:** P1 Critical (data integrity)
**Effort:** 2-4 hours research, then reassess
**Risk:** High (third-party dependency)
**File:** `todos/023-ready-p1-cascade-delete-community-content.md`

**Why This is BLOCKED:**
- üî¥ **django-machina models** cannot be easily modified
- üî¥ `Post`, `Topic`, `Forum` are third-party models
- üî¥ Changing CASCADE to SET_NULL requires model swapping
- üî¥ Model swapping in machina is **poorly documented**

**Research Phase Required (2-4 hours):**
```
Research questions:
1. Can machina models be swapped via AUTH_USER_MODEL pattern?
2. Do proxy models work for FK relationship changes?
3. Is forking machina necessary?
4. What's the migration impact (90+ relationships)?
5. Are there alternative approaches (signals, middleware)?
```

**Two-Phase Approach:**

**Phase 1** (IF research successful):
- Fix custom models only (15 relationships)
- ReviewQueue, ModerationLog, FlaggedContent, PostEditHistory
- CourseReview, PeerReview, Discussion
- Effort: 8-12 hours

**Phase 2** (IF machina swapping works):
- Implement custom Post/Topic models
- Migrate 75 machina relationships
- Extensive testing required
- Effort: 12-20 hours

**Recommendation:**
‚è∏Ô∏è **DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION** - Research first (2-4h)
After research, decide if Phase 1 (custom models) is worth it

---

#### 5. Wagtail Monolith (FALSE ALARM) ‚ùå ARCHIVE THIS

**Status:** Not Actionable
**Priority:** ~~P1~~ ‚Üí Archive
**File:** `todos/025-ready-p1-wagtail-monolith-phase1-CORRECTED.md`

**Why This Should Be Archived:**
- ‚ùå **Original claim was incorrect** - file size misreported as 51,489 lines
- ‚úÖ **Actual size:** 1,262 lines (97.5% smaller than claimed)
- ‚úÖ **Well-organized:** 18 functions/classes with clear separation
- ‚úÖ **Good practices:** Type hints, N+1 prevention, docstrings
- ‚úÖ **No issues:** IDE loads in <1 second, no merge conflicts

**Verification:**
```bash
$ wc -l apps/api/views/wagtail.py
    1262 apps/api/views/wagtail.py

$ grep -c "^def \|^class " apps/api/views/wagtail.py
    18
```

**Action:** Move to archive or downgrade to P2

## Risk Management

### Known Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Type hints break existing code | High | Use mypy strict mode gradually, test thoroughly |
| Keyboard nav affects mouse users | Medium | Ensure mouse interactions still work, test both |
| Integration tests flaky | Medium | Use TransactionTestCase, avoid race conditions |
| CASCADE research reveals impossibility | High | Have backup plan (Phase 1 only, or postpone) |

### Contingency Plans

**If type hints take longer than 8 hours:**
- Focus on ViewSets first (highest value)
- Defer model methods to future session
- Accept 70-80% coverage initially

**If keyboard nav complexity exceeds estimate:**
- Implement Tab navigation first (core requirement)
- Defer arrow keys to future iteration
- Ensure WCAG 2.1.1 minimum compliance

**If integration tests reveal regressions:**
- Fix regressions before proceeding
- Update relevant todos
- Re-run all test suites

**If CASCADE research shows it's not viable:**
- Document findings
- Archive todo #023
- Focus on Phase 1 (custom models) only

---

## Technology Stack Decisions (From Research)

Based on Phase 2 research, here are key technology decisions:

### State Management
**Decision:** Zustand (not Redux)
**Reason:** 70% less boilerplate, simpler API
**Priority:** P2 (future work)

### Caching
**Decision:** Redis
**Reason:** 80% response time reduction
**Priority:** P1 (required for scaling)

### Real-Time Features
**Decision:** Django Channels + WebSockets
**Reason:** Native Django integration
**Priority:** P2 (future work)

### Code Execution Security
**Decision:** gVisor Runtime
**Reason:** Kernel isolation for production
**Priority:** P1 (production deployment)

### Monitoring
**Decision:** Sentry
**Reason:** Agentless, Django-native, <5min setup
**Priority:** P1 (production deployment)

**Note:** These decisions are documented for future Phase 3+ work

## Conclusion

Phase 1 delivered exceptional quality with 6 critical fixes, 63 new tests, and comprehensive documentation. Phase 2 builds on this foundation with a focus on developer experience (type hints), accessibility (keyboard navigation), and quality assurance (integration testing).

The recommended approach is:
1. **Start with Type Hints** (#026) - Quick win, high impact, 6-8 hours
2. **Follow with Accessibility** (#027) - Legal compliance, 8 hours
3. **Add Integration Testing** (#028) - Quality gate, 4 hours
4. **Research CASCADE Deletes** (#023) - Optional, 2-4 hours

This approach maximizes value delivery while managing risk appropriately. After Phase 2 completion, the platform will be well-positioned for production deployment with strong developer tooling, accessibility compliance, and comprehensive test coverage.

**Total Phase 2 Effort:** 16-22 hours (2-3 sessions)
**Expected Completion:** Within 1 week
**Confidence Level:** High (clear requirements, proven patterns, low risk)
