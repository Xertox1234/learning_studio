ai.generate_test_cases(function)
ai.generate_learning_objectives(course, level)
ai.generate_code_examples(concept)
```

## 🔧 Key Configuration Files Modified

| File | Changes Made |
|------|-------------|
| `learning_community/settings/base.py` | Added Wagtail-AI config, fixed middleware, added taggit |
| `learning_community/settings/development.py` | Fixed session engine, cache config, removed duplicates |
| `apps/learning/models.py` | Updated to use `get_user_model()` |
| `apps/exercises/models.py` | Updated to use `get_user_model()` |
| `apps/api/views.py` | Fixed AI service imports |
| `learning_community/urls_simple.py` | Created simplified URLs for development |

## 🗃️ Database Status

- ✅ Fresh migrations created and applied
- ✅ Database schema up to date
- ✅ Superuser account created (username: `admin`)
- ✅ All model relationships corrected

## 🌐 Server Status

- ✅ Django development server running on `0.0.0.0:8000`
- ✅ Wagtail admin accessible and functional
- ✅ AI features operational and tested
- ✅ Session management stable

## 📋 Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing these changes, verify:

- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md, setup guides)
- [ ] All lint/syntax errors resolved
- [ ] Server runs without errors
- [ ] AI features accessible in Wagtail admin
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Migration files included

## 🚀 Next Steps for Local Development

1. **Clone/Pull the updated repository**
2. **Set up environment variables** (especially `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
3. **Run migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
4. **Create superuser**: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. **Start server**: `python manage.py runserver`
6. **Test AI features** in Wagtail admin

## 📝 Important Notes

- **OpenAI API Key Required**: AI features will not work without a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Development Settings**: Use `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=learning_community.settings.development`
- **Database**: Currently using SQLite for development (easily portable)
- **Session Management**: Uses database sessions for stability

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if AI is working
python manage.py shell -c "from apps.learning.services import LearningContentAI; print('AI Service:', LearningContentAI().generate_exercise_explanation('print(1)'))"

# Verify server health
curl -I http://localhost:8000/admin/

# Check migrations
python manage.py showmigrations --plan
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero deployment errors**
- ✅ **AI features functional**
- ✅ **Documentation complete**
- ✅ **Development environment stable**
- ✅ **All tests passing**

The Wagtail-AI integration is now **production-ready** for local development and testing!
