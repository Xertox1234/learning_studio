# Data Integrity and Migration Safety Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Auditor:** Data Integrity Guardian (Claude Code Agent)
**Scope:** Database operations, migrations, transactions, and referential integrity

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL RISKS IDENTIFIED:** 5
**HIGH PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:** 8
**MEDIUM PRIORITY WARNINGS:** 6

This audit reveals several **critical data integrity vulnerabilities** that could lead to data corruption, orphaned records, and referential integrity violations in production. The most serious issues involve missing transaction boundaries in dual-content creation, deleted migrations without proper rollback strategy, and CASCADE delete operations that could result in unintended data loss.

---

## 1. CRITICAL ISSUE: Deleted Migrations Without Rollback Strategy

### Risk Level: CRITICAL - DATA LOSS POTENTIAL

### Affected Files:
- `apps/blog/migrations/0007_forumintegratedblogpage.py` (DELETED, renamed to `.disabled`)
- `apps/forum_integration/migrations/0006_richforumpost.py` (DELETED, not in filesystem)

### Problem Description:

Two migrations have been **deleted from the migration history** but the models they created (`ForumIntegratedBlogPage` and `RichForumPost`) still exist in the codebase:

```python
# apps/blog/models.py - LINE 1553
class ForumIntegratedBlogPage(BlogPage):
    """Blog page that integrates with forum discussions."""
    # Model exists but migration is disabled!
```

### Data Corruption Scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Fresh Database Setup**
   - New developer runs `migrate`
   - Migration 0007 doesn't run (disabled)
   - `ForumIntegratedBlogPage` table doesn't exist
   - Application tries to query it → **DatabaseError**

2. **Scenario 2: Existing Production Database**
   - Production has `blog_forumintegratedblogpage` table with data
   - Migration history shows 0007 as applied
   - New migration tries to recreate the table
   - **Data loss** or migration failure

3. **Scenario 3: Rollback Attempt**
   - Administrator tries to rollback to previous migration
   - Migration 0007 is missing from filesystem
   - Django can't find rollback instructions
   - **Inconsistent state** between database and migration history

### Evidence from Git:

```python
# Deleted migration created this model:
operations = [
    migrations.CreateModel(
        name='ForumIntegratedBlogPage',
        fields=[
            ('blogpage_ptr', models.OneToOneField(
                auto_created=True,
                on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE,  # CASCADE DELETE!
                parent_link=True,
                primary_key=True,
                serialize=False,
                to='blog.blogpage'
            )),
            ('forum_topic_id', models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)),
            ('discussion_forum', models.ForeignKey(
                on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL,  # Orphan potential
                null=True,
                to='forum.forum'
            )),
        ],
    ),
]
```

### Recommendations:

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Restore Migrations:**
   ```bash
   # Rename .disabled back to .py
   mv apps/blog/migrations/0007_forumintegratedblogpage.py.disabled \
      apps/blog/migrations/0007_forumintegratedblogpage.py
   ```

2. **Create Data Migration to Handle Existing Data:**
   ```python
   # Create a new migration to check if table exists
   from django.db import migrations

   def check_and_create_table(apps, schema_editor):
       from django.db import connection
       with connection.cursor() as cursor:
           cursor.execute("""
               SELECT EXISTS (
                   SELECT FROM information_schema.tables
                   WHERE table_name = 'blog_forumintegratedblogpage'
               );
           """)
           exists = cursor.fetchone()[0]
           if not exists:
               # Table doesn't exist, run creation
               pass
   ```

3. **Document Migration Dependencies:**
   - Add clear comments explaining why migration was disabled
   - Create deprecation notice if feature is being removed
   - Plan data migration path for existing production data

---

## 2. CRITICAL ISSUE: Dual Content Creation Without Transaction Rollback

### Risk Level: CRITICAL - DATA INCONSISTENCY

### Affected File:
`apps/api/services/forum_content_service.py:25-60`

### Problem Description:

The `create_integrated_content()` method creates content in **TWO separate systems** (Wagtail CMS + Forum) within a transaction, but lacks proper rollback handling when forum creation fails.

### Code Analysis:

```python
# LINE 44-52
with transaction.atomic():
    content_type = content_data.get('content_type', 'blog_post')

    if content_type == 'blog_post':
        return self._create_blog_with_forum(user, content_data)
    elif content_type == 'forum_topic':
        return self._create_rich_forum_topic(user, content_data)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported content type: {content_type}")
```

**Problem:** The transaction.atomic() wrapper catches exceptions at line 54-59, but:
1. Returns success=False **without rolling back the blog post creation**
2. Blog post is already published to Wagtail
3. Forum topic creation failed
4. **Orphaned blog post** exists without forum discussion

### Data Corruption Scenario:

```
User creates blog post with forum discussion enabled
    ↓
1. Wagtail BlogPage created ✓
2. BlogPage.save_revision().publish() called ✓ (PUBLISHED!)
3. _create_forum_topic() called
    ↓
4. Forum doesn't exist → ValueError
    ↓
5. Exception caught at line 54
    ↓
6. Returns {'success': False, 'error': '...'}
    ↓
RESULT: Blog post is LIVE in Wagtail but has:
  - forum_topic_id = NULL
  - create_forum_topic = True
  - Misleading user interface (shows forum enabled but no topic exists)
```

### Database State After Failure:

```sql
-- Orphaned blog post in inconsistent state
SELECT id, title, forum_topic_id, create_forum_topic
FROM blog_forumintegratedblogpage
WHERE create_forum_topic = TRUE AND forum_topic_id IS NULL;
-- Returns orphaned posts that claim to have forum integration but don't
```

### Recommendations:

**IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:**

```python
def create_integrated_content(self, user: User, content_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create content that publishes to both Wagtail and forum systems."""
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            content_type = content_data.get('content_type', 'blog_post')

            if content_type == 'blog_post':
                # Create blog WITHOUT publishing first
                result = self._create_blog_draft(user, content_data)
                blog_page = result['blog_page']

                # Create forum topic (can fail)
                if content_data.get('forum_enabled', True):
                    try:
                        forum_topic = self._create_forum_topic_for_blog(blog_page, user, content_data)
                        blog_page.forum_topic_id = forum_topic.id
                        blog_page.save()
                    except Exception as forum_error:
                        # Forum creation failed - DO NOT PUBLISH BLOG
                        self.logger.error(f"Forum creation failed: {forum_error}")
                        raise  # Rollback entire transaction

                # ONLY publish after both succeed
                blog_page.save_revision().publish()

                return {
                    'success': True,
                    'blog_post': {...},
                    'forum_topic': {...}
                }

            elif content_type == 'forum_topic':
                return self._create_rich_forum_topic(user, content_data)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Unsupported content type: {content_type}")

    except Exception as e:
        # Transaction will auto-rollback here
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to create integrated content: {e}")
        return {
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e),
            'rollback': True  # Indicate rollback occurred
        }
```

## 3. CRITICAL ISSUE: Forum Topic Creation in Model.save() Method

### Risk Level: CRITICAL - UNCONTROLLED SIDE EFFECTS

### Affected File:
`apps/blog/models.py:1623-1644`

### Problem Description:

`ForumIntegratedBlogPage.save()` creates forum topics as a **side effect** of saving a model. This violates Django best practices and creates multiple data integrity risks.

### Code Analysis:

```python
# LINE 1623-1644
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """Override save to handle forum topic creation."""
    is_new = self.pk is None
    was_live = False

    if not is_new:
        try:
            old_instance = ForumIntegratedBlogPage.objects.get(pk=self.pk)
            was_live = old_instance.live
        except ForumIntegratedBlogPage.DoesNotExist:
            pass

    # Call parent save first
    super().save(*args, **kwargs)  # SAVED TO DATABASE

    # Create forum topic if conditions are met
    if (self.create_forum_topic and
        self.live and
        not self.forum_topic_id and
        (is_new or not was_live)):
        self._create_forum_topic()  # NO TRANSACTION PROTECTION!
```

### Data Integrity Issues:

1. **Race Condition Risk:**
   ```python
   # Thread 1: Saves blog post (pk=123)
   super().save(*args, **kwargs)  # Blog post committed

   # Thread 2: Reads blog post pk=123
   post = ForumIntegratedBlogPage.objects.get(pk=123)
   # Sees: forum_topic_id = NULL, create_forum_topic = True

   # Thread 1: Creates forum topic (FAILS)
   self._create_forum_topic()  # DatabaseError: Forum doesn't exist

   # RESULT: Blog post saved with inconsistent state
   # forum_topic_id is NULL but should have been set
   ```

2. **No Rollback on Failure:**
   ```python
   # _create_forum_topic() is called AFTER super().save()
   # If it fails, the blog post is already committed
   # No way to rollback the blog post creation
   ```

3. **Silent Failures:**
   ```python
   # LINE 1646-1714 - _create_forum_topic()
   try:
       # ... create topic ...
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Failed to create forum topic for blog post {self.title}: {e}")
       # SILENT FAILURE - no exception raised
       # Blog post exists in inconsistent state
   ```

### Real-World Failure Scenario:

```
1. Admin creates ForumIntegratedBlogPage in Wagtail admin
2. Sets create_forum_topic = True
3. Sets discussion_forum = None (forgot to select)
4. Clicks "Publish"
    ↓
5. save() is called
6. super().save() commits blog post to database ✓
7. _create_forum_topic() is called
8. Line 1653-1661: No forum specified
    ↓
9. Tries to get default "Blog Discussions" forum
10. Forum.DoesNotExist raised
11. logger.warning() and return (no exception)
    ↓
RESULT: Published blog post with:
  - create_forum_topic = True
  - discussion_forum = NULL
  - forum_topic_id = NULL
  - Users see "Join the discussion" button
  - Clicking it leads to 404 error
```

### Database Queries Without Constraints:

```python
# LINE 1675-1677 - Potential for SQL injection via topic_title
topic = Topic.objects.create(
    forum=forum,
    subject=topic_title,  # Not validated or sanitized!
    poster=self.author or self.owner,
    # ...
)
```

### Recommendations:

**CRITICAL REFACTOR REQUIRED:**

1. **Remove Forum Creation from save():**
   ```python
   # apps/blog/models.py
   class ForumIntegratedBlogPage(BlogPage):
       def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
           # Only save the model - NO SIDE EFFECTS
           super().save(*args, **kwargs)

       def publish_with_forum(self, user, forum_data=None):
           """Separate method for publishing with forum integration."""
           with transaction.atomic():
               # Save draft
               self.live = False
               self.save()

               # Create forum topic
               if self.create_forum_topic and forum_data:
                   topic = self._create_forum_topic_safe(forum_data)
                   if topic:
                       self.forum_topic_id = topic.id
                       self.save()

               # Publish only if all succeeded
               self.live = True
               self.save_revision().publish()
   ```

2. **Use Django Signals Instead:**
   ```python
   # apps/forum_integration/signals.py
   from django.db.models.signals import post_save
   from django.dispatch import receiver
   from apps.blog.models import ForumIntegratedBlogPage

   @receiver(post_save, sender=ForumIntegratedBlogPage)
   def create_forum_topic_on_publish(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
       """Create forum topic when blog is published."""
       if created and instance.live and instance.create_forum_topic:
           with transaction.atomic():
               try:
                   topic = create_forum_topic(instance)
                   instance.forum_topic_id = topic.id
                   instance.save(update_fields=['forum_topic_id'])
               except Exception as e:
                   logger.error(f"Failed to create forum topic: {e}")
                   # Optionally: Set create_forum_topic = False to prevent retries
   ```

3. **Add Database Constraints:**
   ```python
   # apps/blog/models.py
   class ForumIntegratedBlogPage(BlogPage):
       class Meta:
           constraints = [
               models.CheckConstraint(
                   check=~(
                       models.Q(create_forum_topic=True) &
                       models.Q(discussion_forum__isnull=True)
                   ),
                   name='forum_required_when_integration_enabled',
                   violation_error_message='Discussion forum must be specified when forum integration is enabled'
               )
           ]
   ```

---

## 4. HIGH PRIORITY: Missing NULL Handling in Forum Statistics

### Risk Level: HIGH - RUNTIME ERRORS

### Affected File:
`apps/forum_integration/models.py:305-343`

### Problem Description:

The `ReviewQueue.calculate_priority_score()` method assumes `created_at` is always set, but it can be NULL during object creation, leading to runtime errors.

### Code Analysis:

```python
# LINE 314-319
def calculate_priority_score(self):
    """Calculate priority score based on multiple factors"""
    score = 0.0

    # Base priority score
    priority_scores = {1: 100, 2: 75, 3: 50, 4: 25}
    score += priority_scores.get(self.priority, 50)

    # Age factor (older items get higher priority)
    if self.created_at:  # GOOD: NULL check exists
        age_hours = (timezone.now() - self.created_at).total_seconds() / 3600
        score += min(age_hours * 0.5, 50)
    else:
        # If created_at is None (during creation), assume 0 age
        score += 0  # INCONSISTENT: Why add 0?
```

**Issue:** The NULL check at line 314 is good, but the handling is inconsistent. During object creation, `created_at` is None, which means new items get artificially lower priority scores.

### Related Issues in Same Model:

```python
# LINE 364-367
@property
def age_in_hours(self):
    if self.created_at:
        return (timezone.now() - self.created_at).total_seconds() / 3600
    return 0  # Returns 0 during creation - masks the NULL state
```

### Data Corruption Scenario:

```
1. ReviewQueue.objects.create(...) called
2. calculate_priority_score() called in save() (line 347)
3. created_at is NULL (auto_now_add hasn't fired yet)
4. Age component = 0
5. Item gets lower priority than it should
6. After save completes, created_at is set
7. Priority score is now stale and incorrect
```

### Recommendations:

```python
def calculate_priority_score(self):
    """Calculate priority score based on multiple factors"""
    score = 0.0

    # Base priority score
    priority_scores = {1: 100, 2: 75, 3: 50, 4: 25}
    score += priority_scores.get(self.priority, 50)

    # Age factor (older items get higher priority)
    if self.created_at:
        age_hours = (timezone.now() - self.created_at).total_seconds() / 3600
        score += min(age_hours * 0.5, 50)
    else:
        # During creation, treat as newly created (not penalty)
        # Assume 0 hours age, no bonus or penalty
        # Score will be recalculated on next save with actual created_at
        pass  # Explicitly do nothing instead of score += 0

    # ... rest of scoring logic ...

    return score

def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # Don't recalculate score if created_at is not set yet
    if self.created_at or self.pk:
        self.score = self.calculate_priority_score()
    else:
        # First save - use default priority score
        self.score = {1: 100, 2: 75, 3: 50, 4: 25}.get(self.priority, 50)

    # Set resolved_at when status changes to resolved
    if self.status in ['approved', 'rejected'] and not self.resolved_at:
        self.resolved_at = timezone.now()

    super().save(*args, **kwargs)

    # Recalculate score after first save when created_at is set
    if not self.pk and self.created_at:
        self.score = self.calculate_priority_score()
        super().save(update_fields=['score'])
```

---

## 5. HIGH PRIORITY: CASCADE Deletes Without Safeguards

### Risk Level: HIGH - UNINTENDED DATA LOSS

### Problem Description:

Multiple models use `on_delete=CASCADE` without documented safeguards, which could lead to **mass data deletion** if parent records are accidentally deleted.

### Affected Models:

#### 1. Forum Integration - TrustLevel (Line 34)
```python
class TrustLevel(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(
        User,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,  # Deleting user deletes trust level
        related_name='trust_level'
    )
```

**Risk:** If a user account is deleted, all trust level progress is lost. No audit trail.

#### 2. Review Queue - Multiple References (Lines 260-262)
```python
class ReviewQueue(models.Model):
    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    topic = models.ForeignKey(Topic, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    reported_user = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,  # CASCADE on user delete
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        related_name='forum_reported_reviews'
    )
```

**Cascade Chain:**
```
Delete Post → Deletes ReviewQueue items → Deletes ModerationLog entries
    ↓
Result: Complete audit trail erased
```

#### 3. Blog Models - ForumIntegratedBlogPage (Deleted migration line 10)
```python
('blogpage_ptr', models.OneToOneField(
    auto_created=True,
    on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.CASCADE,  # Parent delete cascades
    parent_link=True,
    primary_key=True,
    serialize=False,
    to='blog.blogpage'
)),
```

**Risk:** Deleting BlogPage deletes ForumIntegratedBlogPage, but:
- Forum topic remains orphaned (no back-reference to blog)
- Posts in forum topic remain but point to non-existent blog post

### Real-World Deletion Scenario:

```sql
-- Admin accidentally deletes a user account
DELETE FROM users_user WHERE id = 123;

-- CASCADE triggers chain reaction:
1. DELETE FROM forum_integration_trustlevel WHERE user_id = 123;
2. DELETE FROM forum_integration_useractivity WHERE user_id = 123;
3. DELETE FROM forum_integration_readingprogress WHERE user_id = 123;
4. DELETE FROM forum_integration_userbadge WHERE user_id = 123;
5. DELETE FROM forum_integration_userpoints WHERE user_id = 123;
6. DELETE FROM forum_integration_pointhistory WHERE user_id = 123;
7. DELETE FROM forum_integration_reviewqueue WHERE reported_user_id = 123;
8. DELETE FROM forum_integration_moderationlog WHERE target_user_id = 123;
9. DELETE FROM forum_conversation_post WHERE poster_id = 123;
10. DELETE FROM forum_conversation_topic WHERE poster_id = 123;

-- Result: Years of user contribution data GONE with single DELETE
```

### Recommendations:

**1. Add Soft Delete Pattern:**
```python
# apps/users/models.py
class User(AbstractUser):
    is_deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

    def soft_delete(self):
        """Soft delete user account - preserves data integrity."""
        with transaction.atomic():
            self.is_deleted = True
            self.deleted_at = timezone.now()
            self.is_active = False
            self.save()

            # Preserve data but anonymize
            self.email = f'deleted_{self.id}@deleted.local'
            self.username = f'deleted_user_{self.id}'
            self.save()

    class Meta:
        default_manager_name = 'objects'

    objects = models.Manager()  # Includes deleted users
    active_objects = models.Manager()  # Exclude deleted users
```

**2. Change CASCADE to PROTECT:**
```python
class ReviewQueue(models.Model):
    # Prevent accidental deletion
    post = models.ForeignKey(
        Post,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT,  # Cannot delete post with pending reviews
        null=True,
        blank=True
    )
    topic = models.ForeignKey(
        Topic,
        on_delete=models.PROTECT,  # Cannot delete topic with pending reviews
        null=True,
        blank=True
    )
```

**3. Add Pre-Delete Signals:**
```python
# apps/forum_integration/signals.py
from django.db.models.signals import pre_delete

## 6. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Batch Operations Without Error Handling

### Risk Level: MEDIUM - PARTIAL UPDATES

### Affected File:
`apps/api/services/review_queue_service.py:646-663`

### Problem Description:

The `recalculate_priorities()` method updates multiple ReviewQueue items without proper transaction handling or error recovery.

### Code Analysis:

```python
# LINE 646-663
def recalculate_priorities(self) -> None:
    """Recalculate priority scores for all pending items."""
    from apps.forum_integration.models import ReviewQueue, ModerationLog

    pending_items = ReviewQueue.objects.filter(status='pending')

    for item in pending_items:  # NO TRANSACTION BOUNDARY
        old_score = item.score
        item.save()  # Could fail

        if abs(item.score - old_score) > 10:
            ModerationLog.objects.create(  # Could fail
                action_type='escalate' if item.score > old_score else 'de_escalate',
                moderator=None,
                review_item=item,
                reason=f'Priority score updated: {old_score:.1f} → {item.score:.1f}',
                details={'old_score': old_score, 'new_score': item.score}
            )
```

### Data Corruption Scenario:

```
pending_items = [item1, item2, item3, item4, item5]
    ↓
1. item1.save() → SUCCESS (score updated)
2. item2.save() → SUCCESS (score updated)
3. item3.save() → FAILS (DatabaseError: deadlock detected)
    ↓
RESULT:
  - item1 and item2 have new scores ✓
  - item3, item4, item5 have old scores ✗
  - Inconsistent priority queue
  - Some items appear more urgent than they should be
```

### Recommendations:

```python
def recalculate_priorities(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Recalculate priority scores for all pending items.
    Returns summary of updates and any errors.
    """
    from apps.forum_integration.models import ReviewQueue, ModerationLog
    from django.db import transaction, IntegrityError

    pending_items = ReviewQueue.objects.filter(status='pending').select_for_update()

    updated_count = 0
    error_count = 0
    errors = []

    for item in pending_items:
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                old_score = item.score

                # Save with updated score
                item.save()
                updated_count += 1

                # Log significant changes
                if abs(item.score - old_score) > 10:
                    ModerationLog.objects.create(
                        action_type='escalate' if item.score > old_score else 'de_escalate',
                        moderator=None,
                        review_item=item,
                        reason=f'Priority score updated: {old_score:.1f} → {item.score:.1f}',
                        details={'old_score': old_score, 'new_score': item.score}
                    )

        except IntegrityError as e:
            error_count += 1
            errors.append({
                'item_id': item.id,
                'error': str(e)
            })
            logger.error(f"Failed to update priority for ReviewQueue {item.id}: {e}")
            continue  # Continue with other items

    return {
        'updated': updated_count,
        'errors': error_count,
        'error_details': errors,
        'total_pending': pending_items.count()
    }
```

## 7. Migration Dependency Analysis

### Current Migration State:

#### Blog App:
```
0001_initial.py
0002_exercisepage_learningindexpage_...
0003_codeplaygroundpage.py
0004_wagtailcourseenrollment.py
0005_alter_lessonpage_content.py
0006_stepbasedexercisepage_and_more.py
0007_exercisepage_sequence_number_and_more.py ← Active
0007_forumintegratedblogpage.py.disabled ← CONFLICT!
0008_alter_stepbasedexercisepage_exercise_steps.py
```

**CRITICAL CONFLICT:** Two migrations numbered 0007 exist!
- One is active (sequence_number)
- One is disabled (forumintegratedblogpage)

This will cause migration conflicts when:
1. Running `makemigrations` detects duplicate numbers
2. Attempting to merge branches
3. New developers clone the repository

#### Forum Integration App:
```
0001_initial.py
0002_readingprogress_trustlevel_useractivity.py
0003_useractivity_active_sessions_...
0004_add_review_queue_models.py
0005_add_badge_gamification_models.py
[0006_richforumpost.py MISSING - completely deleted]
```

**CRITICAL GAP:** Migration 0006 completely removed from filesystem but may exist in production database migration history.

### Recommendations:

**1. Resolve Migration Number Conflicts:**
```bash
# Rename the newer migration to 0009
cd apps/blog/migrations
mv 0008_alter_stepbasedexercisepage_exercise_steps.py \
   0009_alter_stepbasedexercisepage_exercise_steps.py

# Update dependency in file
sed -i '' 's/0007_exercisepage_sequence_number/0008_exercisepage_sequence_number/' \
   0009_alter_stepbasedexercisepage_exercise_steps.py
```

**2. Restore Disabled Migration:**
```bash
# Either restore it:
mv apps/blog/migrations/0007_forumintegratedblogpage.py.disabled \
   apps/blog/migrations/0008_forumintegratedblogpage.py

# OR create a proper deletion migration:
python manage.py makemigrations blog --empty -n remove_forum_integrated_blog
```

**3. Document Migration History:**
Create `MIGRATION_HISTORY.md`:
```markdown
# Migration History and Deprecations

## Disabled Migrations

### 0007_forumintegratedblogpage.py (Disabled 2025-10-11)
- **Reason:** Feature deprecated in favor of separate content management
- **Production Impact:** Tables may exist in production databases
- **Rollback Strategy:** Do not delete tables until confirmed all instances migrated
- **Timeline:** Tables scheduled for removal in v2.0 (2026-01-01)
```

## 8. Referential Integrity Concerns

### Issue: Orphaned Forum Topics

**Scenario:**
```python
# apps/blog/models.py - LINE 1706-1709
# Save the topic ID to this blog post
self.forum_topic_id = topic.id
ForumIntegratedBlogPage.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).update(
    forum_topic_id=topic.id
)
```

**Problem:** Uses `.update()` which bypasses signals and doesn't update Wagtail revision history.

**Orphan Risk:**
```sql
-- Topic exists in forum
SELECT id, subject FROM forum_conversation_topic WHERE id = 123;
-- Returns: 123 | "Discussion: Cool Blog Post"

-- Blog post references it
SELECT id, title, forum_topic_id FROM blog_forumintegratedblogpage WHERE id = 456;
-- Returns: 456 | "Cool Blog Post" | 123

-- But Wagtail revision history shows:
SELECT content_json FROM wagtailcore_pagerevision
WHERE page_id = 456 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
-- forum_topic_id: null (old value preserved in revision)
```

**Impact:**
- Wagtail preview shows "no forum discussion"
- Live page shows forum discussion
- Reverting to draft loses forum connection
- Publishing draft again creates SECOND forum topic

### Recommendations:

```python
# apps/blog/models.py
def _create_forum_topic(self):
    """Create associated forum topic."""
    try:
        from machina.apps.forum.models import Forum
        from machina.apps.forum_conversation.models import Topic, Post

        # ... existing topic creation logic ...

        # Update properly through model save, not .update()
        self.forum_topic_id = topic.id
        self.save(update_fields=['forum_topic_id'])  # Triggers Wagtail revision

        # Also update current revision
        latest_revision = self.get_latest_revision()
        if latest_revision:
            content = latest_revision.content
            content['forum_topic_id'] = topic.id
            latest_revision.content = content
            latest_revision.save()

        logger.info(f"Created forum topic {topic.id} for blog post {self.title}")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create forum topic for blog post {self.title}: {e}")
        raise  # Don't silently fail
```

2. ✅ Fix dual content creation transaction handling (ForumContentService)
3. ✅ Remove forum topic creation from BlogPage.save() method
4. ✅ Add NULL handling in ReviewQueue.calculate_priority_score()
5. ✅ Resolve migration number conflicts (two 0007 migrations in blog app)

### High Priority (Next Sprint):

6. ⚠️ Change CASCADE to PROTECT on critical foreign keys
7. ⚠️ Add pre-delete signals to prevent accidental data loss
8. ⚠️ Implement soft delete for User model
9. ⚠️ Add transaction boundaries to batch operations
10. ⚠️ Add database constraints for data validation

### Medium Priority (Backlog):

11. 📋 Create comprehensive migration rollback documentation
12. 📋 Add integration tests for dual content creation
13. 📋 Implement audit logging for all deletions
14. 📋 Add database constraint checks in CI/CD pipeline
15. 📋 Create data migration guide for production deployments

## Testing Recommendations

### Required Test Cases:

1. **Transaction Rollback Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_blog_forum_creation_rollback_on_forum_error(self):
       """Test that blog post is not created if forum creation fails."""
       with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
           service.create_integrated_content(
               user=self.user,
               content_data={'forum_enabled': True, 'forum_id': 99999}  # Non-existent
           )

       # Verify NO blog post was created
       self.assertEqual(ForumIntegratedBlogPage.objects.count(), 0)
   ```

2. **Cascade Delete Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_user_deletion_prevents_cascade_with_content(self):
       """Test that users with content cannot be deleted."""
       user = User.objects.create(username='test')
       Topic.objects.create(poster=user, ...)

       with self.assertRaises(ProtectionError):
           user.delete()
   ```

3. **Migration Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_migrations_are_reversible(self):
       """Test all migrations can be rolled back."""
       call_command('migrate', 'blog', '0001')
       call_command('migrate', 'blog')
       # Should complete without errors
   ```

---

## Compliance and Audit Trail

### GDPR Concerns:

**Issue:** CASCADE deletes remove audit trail for user data deletion.

**Requirement:** GDPR Article 30 requires maintaining records of processing activities including deletions.

**Recommendation:**
```python
# apps/users/models.py
class UserDeletionLog(models.Model):
    """GDPR-compliant deletion audit trail."""
    user_id = models.IntegerField()
    username = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    email = models.EmailField()
    deletion_reason = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    deleted_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    # Preserve aggregated stats (not personal data)
    total_posts = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    total_topics = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    account_age_days = models.IntegerField(default=0)

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-deleted_at']
```

## Conclusion

This audit has identified **5 critical data integrity issues** that require immediate remediation:

1. Deleted migrations without rollback strategy
2. Dual content creation without proper transaction rollback
3. Forum topic creation in model save() method
4. Missing NULL handling in priority calculations
5. Unsafe CASCADE deletes

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Production Data Loss Risk:** HIGH
- **Data Inconsistency Risk:** CRITICAL
- **Referential Integrity Risk:** HIGH
- **Audit Compliance Risk:** MEDIUM

**Estimated Remediation Effort:**
- Critical fixes: 8-16 hours
- High priority fixes: 16-24 hours
- Medium priority fixes: 8-12 hours
- Testing and validation: 16 hours
- **Total: 48-68 hours (6-9 business days)**

All code changes should be reviewed by the code-review-specialist agent before deployment to production.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this report with the development team
2. Prioritize critical fixes for immediate implementation
3. Create tickets for high and medium priority items
4. Schedule testing sprint for all database operations
5. Update deployment runbook with migration safety checks
