## üõ†Ô∏è Management Commands

### Performance & Caching Commands

#### Cache Warming
Preload frequently accessed data into cache for improved performance:

```bash
# Warm all caches
python manage.py warm_cache

# Warm user-specific caches
python manage.py warm_cache --user-id=123

# Quiet mode (no output)
python manage.py warm_cache --quiet
```

#### Performance Benchmarking
Measure API endpoint performance with detailed statistics:

```bash
# Basic benchmark (10 iterations)
python manage.py benchmark

# Custom iterations
python manage.py benchmark --iterations=50

# Warm cache before benchmarking
python manage.py benchmark --warm-cache

# Clear cache before benchmarking
python manage.py benchmark --clear-cache

# Verbose output with iteration details
python manage.py benchmark --verbose
```

**Performance Ratings:**
- **Response Time**: <100ms (EXCELLENT), 100-200ms (GOOD), 200-500ms (FAIR), >500ms (SLOW)
