    Sanitize and render embed code safely.

    This filter is specifically designed to replace Django's |safe filter
    for user-supplied embed code. It sanitizes the HTML to prevent XSS attacks
    while allowing legitimate embeds from trusted sources.

    Security features:
    - Removes <script> tags and event handlers
    - Blocks javascript: protocol in URLs
    - Restricts iframes to whitelisted domains (YouTube, Vimeo, CodePen, etc.)
    - Sanitizes CSS to prevent CSS-based attacks

    Usage in templates:
        {% load forum_filters %}
        {{ embed_code|safe_embed|safe }}

    IMPORTANT: The |safe filter is still needed AFTER sanitization because
    we want to render the sanitized HTML. The sanitization happens first,
    making the subsequent |safe filter actually safe to use.

    Args:
        value (str): Raw HTML embed code from user

    Returns:
        str: Sanitized HTML marked as safe for Django template rendering

    Example:
        {{ "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"|safe_embed }}
        # Returns: "" (script tags removed)

        {{ "<iframe src='https://youtube.com/embed/abc'></iframe>"|safe_embed }}
        # Returns: "<iframe src='https://youtube.com/embed/abc'></iframe>" (allowed)

    # ðŸ”’ CRITICAL SECURITY: mark_safe() is ONLY safe here because
    # sanitize_embed_code() has already removed all XSS vectors via bleach + domain validation.
    # NEVER use mark_safe() on unsanitized user input!
    # This is the critical security fix for CVE-2024-XSS-002
