# Fix TODO Placeholder in Mock Exercise Function Name

## Resolution Summary

✅ **RESOLVED** on 2025-10-19 in commit `ef2378a`

**What was fixed**: Replaced confusing "TODO" placeholder with realistic function name `find_maximum` in test exercise interface view.

**GitHub Issue**: #27
**Commit**: `ef2378ae02c7ac784a0b30159c7f8d4c34fa7299`
**E2E Test**: `e2e-tests/test-code-quality-fixes.spec.js:74-78`

---

## Problem Statement

The test exercise interface view uses "TODO" as a placeholder for the `function_name` field in mock exercise data. This creates confusing and unrealistic test data that doesn't properly simulate production behavior.

**Location**: `apps/learning/views.py:298-300`

**Original Code**:
```python
self.function_name = 'TODO'
self.starter_code = 'def TODO(numbers):\n    # Find max number\n    pass'
self.solution_code = 'def TODO(numbers):\n    return max(numbers)'
```

**Impact**:
- Test interface shows `def TODO(numbers):` which is confusing
- Doesn't accurately represent real exercise data structure
- Could mislead developers testing the exercise interface
- Makes it unclear whether "TODO" is intentional or needs fixing
- Poor developer experience when testing/debugging the interface

## Findings

**Discovered by**: Code Triage (TODO/FIXME comment scan)

**Context**:
- This is in a test/demo view (`test_exercise_interface_view`)
- Used to preview the exercise UI without a real exercise
- The exercise is about finding the maximum number in a list
- All other mock data is properly filled in (title, description, etc.)

**Why This Matters**:
1. Test data should be realistic to properly validate UI/UX
2. "TODO" makes it unclear if this is placeholder code that needs work
3. Confuses developers who might try to fix "TODO" thinking it's broken
4. Doesn't help validate function name rendering in the UI

## Solution Implemented

### Option 1: Use Realistic Function Name (IMPLEMENTED)

**Pros**:
- Clear, realistic test data
- Properly represents production use case
- Follows Python naming conventions
- Makes test more valuable for UI validation

**Cons**:
- None

**Effort**: Small (< 5 minutes)
**Risk**: Low (simple text change)

**Implementation**:
```python
self.function_name = 'find_maximum'
self.starter_code = 'def find_maximum(numbers):\n    # Find max number\n    pass'
self.solution_code = 'def find_maximum(numbers):\n    return max(numbers)'
```

Alternative names considered:
- `get_max` - shorter, still clear
- `max_number` - descriptive
- `find_max` - concise

**Chosen**: `find_maximum` - Most descriptive, follows Python conventions, matches exercise description ("Find Maximum")

## Technical Details

**Affected Files**:
- `apps/learning/views.py:285-323` (test_exercise_interface_view)
- Specifically lines 298-300 → Now line 302-304

**Related Components**:
- Exercise interface template (uses function_name for display)
- Code editor component (renders starter/solution code)

**Database Changes**: None (mock data only)

**Test Coverage**:
- E2E test added: `e2e-tests/test-code-quality-fixes.spec.js:74-78`
- Manual testing: Visit `/test-exercise-interface/` and verify function name displays correctly
- Visual verification: Code editor shows `def find_maximum(numbers):` instead of `def TODO(numbers):`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `function_name` changed from "TODO" to a realistic name
- [x] `starter_code` uses the same function name
- [x] `solution_code` uses the same function name
- [x] Manual verification shows improved test interface
- [x] Function name is consistent across all mock code fields
- [x] Python naming conventions followed (snake_case)
- [x] E2E test coverage added

## Work Log

### 2025-10-19 - Initial Discovery

**By:** Claude Triage System
**Actions:**
- Issue discovered during TODO/FIXME comment scan
- Categorized as P2 (Important) - code quality improvement
- Estimated effort: Small (< 5 minutes)
- Marked as ready to pick up

**Learnings:**
- Test/mock data should be as realistic as possible
- Avoid using "TODO" in code unless it truly marks incomplete work
- Good test data improves developer experience and UI validation

### 2025-10-19 - Resolution

**By:** Claude Code
**Commit:** `ef2378a` - "Fix code quality issues #016 and #017, fix login redirect bug"
**Actions:**
- Changed `function_name` from 'TODO' to 'find_maximum'
- Updated `starter_code` to use consistent function name
- Updated `solution_code` to use consistent function name
- Added E2E test to verify fix and prevent regression

**Results:**
- Test interface now displays realistic function name
- Code quality improved
- Better developer experience when testing/debugging
- Follows Python PEP 8 conventions
- E2E test coverage ensures no regression

### 2025-10-20 - Archival

**By:** Claude Code
**GitHub Issue:** #27 - "chore: Archive TODO #016 - Fix TODO Placeholder in Mock Exercise (Already Resolved)"
**Actions:**
- Created GitHub issue documenting resolution
- Archived TODO file to `todos/archive/`
- Updated file header with resolution metadata
- Marked all acceptance criteria as completed

## Notes

- This was a quick win for code quality
- Low risk, high clarity benefit
- Good first issue for someone learning the codebase
- Consider reviewing other mock/test data for similar issues (DONE - no other instances found)
